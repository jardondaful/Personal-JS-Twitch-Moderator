# Personal-JS-Twitch-Moderator
This acts as a personal moderator for my Twitch channel. It will notify me and the viewers of contributions to my channel such as new followers, subscriptions, cheers, etc., the state of the bot's connectivity, and the current status of my livestream (online, offline, hosting, etc.)
